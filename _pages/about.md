Hi! I’m a <font color="#009f06">PhD student</font> in Epidemiology and Population Health at Stanford, co-advised by [Mathew Kiang](https://mathewkiang.com/aboutme/) and [Michelle Odden](https://profiles.stanford.edu/michelle-odden). My research sits at the intersection of big data, population health, and aging-related diseases. Through my PhD, I’m exploring how passive sensor data from smartphones and clinical biospecimen samples can be combined to assess how stress, physical inactivity, and poor sleep contribute to early chronic disease risk and accelerated aging in young adults.

As an <font color="#009f06">amateur artist and information designer</font>, I’m dedicated to making health data more accessible to the public through effective science communication and visual storytelling—especially for low-income and marginalized communities. You’ll often find me at Stanford’s d.school, experimenting with ways to blend science, design, and print.

Outside of lab, I'm usually climbing 🧗🏻‍♀️, playing music 🎶, or spending quality time with friends and family .
