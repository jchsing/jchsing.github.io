Hi! I’m a <font color="seagreen">PhD student</font> in Epidemiology and Population Health at Stanford, co-advised by Drs. [Mathew Kiang](https://mathewkiang.com/aboutme/) and [Michelle Odden](https://profiles.stanford.edu/michelle-odden). My research sits at the intersection of big data, population health, and aging-related diseases. Through my PhD, I’m exploring how passive sensor data (e.g., GPS, accelerometer) from smartphones and clinically collected DNA samples (e.g., saliva) can be combined to assess how stress, physical inactivity, and poor sleep contribute to early chronic disease risk and accelerated aging in young adults.

As an <font color="seagreen">artist and information designer</font>, I’m dedicated to making health data more accessible to the public through effective science communication and visual storytelling—especially for low-income and marginalized communities. You’ll often find me at Stanford’s d.school, experimenting with ways to blend science, design, and print.

<font color="seagreen">Outside the lab</font>, I’m usually climbing outdoors or at the gym, making music, or spending quality time with friends and family.
