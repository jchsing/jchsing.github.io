Hi! I’m a **PhD student** in Epidemiology and Population Health at Stanford, co-advised by [Mathew Kiang](https://mathewkiang.com/aboutme/) and [Michelle Odden](https://profiles.stanford.edu/michelle-odden). My research sits at the intersection of big data, population health, and aging-related diseases. Through my PhD, I’m exploring how passive sensor data from smartphones and clinical biomarkers of aging can be combined to assess how stress, physical inactivity, and poor sleep contribute to early chronic disease risk and accelerated aging in young adults.

As an **amateur artist and information designer**, I’m passionate about making health data more accessible to the public through effective science communication and visual storytelling—especially for low-income and marginalized communities. You’ll often find me at [Stanford’s d.school](https://dschool.stanford.edu/), experimenting with ways to blend science, design, and printmaking.

**Outside of lab**, I'm usually climbing 🧗🏻‍♀️, crocheting 🧶, playing music 🎻, or spending quality time 🕰️ with friends and family.
