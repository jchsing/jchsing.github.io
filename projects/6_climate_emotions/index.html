Data are from participants enrolled in the Stanford WELL for Life Study. Recognizing the link between well-being and emotions related to climate change, the study surveyed around 600 participants in 2022 about their emotions related to change change. Here, we compare how these emotions intersect across different demographic variables and mental health conditions, aiming to answer a crucial climate swerve question:</p> <h4 id="who-are-most-affected-by-the-emotional-challenges-of-climate-change">“who are most affected by the emotional challenges of climate change?”</h4> <p>We also wanted to know:</p> <ul> <li>How do climate emotions change across demographics?</li> <li>How do climate emotions compound across other mental health issues, including depression and loneliness?</li> </ul> <p><strong>goal:</strong> the purpose of this project was to (1) analyze data related to a climate-related question, (2) gain hands-on experience with various data visualization tools, and (3) make it as interactive as possible.
