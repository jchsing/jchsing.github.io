**background:** in this data visualization project, we delve into the emotional impact of climate change by visually exploring climate-related emotions surveyed in four Bay Area counties (i.e., San Mateo County, Santa Clara County, San Francisco County, and Alameda County). Data are from participants enrolled in the Stanford WELL for Life Study. Recognizing the link between well-being and emotions related to climate change, the study surveyed around 600 participants in 2022 about their emotions related to change change. Here, we compare how these emotions intersect across different demographic variables and mental health conditions, aiming to answer a crucial climate swerve question:  
#### "who are most affected by the emotional challenges of climate change?"

We also wanted to know:
* How do climate emotions change across demographics?
* How do climate emotions compound across other mental health issues, including depression and loneliness?

**goal:** the purpose of this project was to (1) analyze data related to a climate-related question, (2) gain hands-on experience with various data visualization tools, and (3) make it as interactive as possible. Data for this project was used with permission from the Principal Investigator of the Stanford WELL for Life Study.

**Measures:**
* <u>Climate emotions:</u>
    * Depending on the use case, we categorized the responses for each climate emotion in the following ways: 
        * Original: 1, Never | 2, Almost Never | 3, Sometimes | 4, Fairly Often | 5, Very Often
        * Method A: 1, Never or Almost Never | 2, Sometimes | 3, Fairly Often or Very Often
        * Method B: 1, Yes (Sometimes or Fairly Often or Very Often) | 2, No (Almost Never or Never)
* <u>Clinical Depression:</u>
    * “Have you ever been told by a doctor or other health professional that you had or have depression?”
        * 1, Yes | 0, No | 2, Don’t know
* <u>UCLA Loneliness Scale:</u>
    * “During the last two weeks, how often did you feel…”
            * ...that you lacked companionship?
            *...left out?
            * ...isolated from others?
        * 3, Often | 2, Sometimes | 1, Hardly ever
    * Scoring: sum all three items, 3-5 = Not Lonely and 6-9 = Lonely
* <u>Exposure to nature:</u>
    * “How often did you do something outside for a period of time lasting more than 10 minutes?”
        * 1, Never | 2, Almost Never | 3, Sometimes | 4, Fairly Often | 5, Very Often
