**background:** the National Heart Lung and Blood Institute (NHLBI) has launched an epidemiological cohort that focuses on Asian American, Native Hawaiian or Pacific Islander (NHPI) populations. It is called MOSAAIC, which stands for Multi-ethnic Observational Study in American Asian and Pacific Islander Communities. This study aims to understand cardiovascular disease to improve prevention in these understudied populations.

The study will take place at six research institutions — the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Center in Seattle, Washington, the study’s coordinating center; and five clinical/community field centers — the University of Hawaii at Mānoa, Stanford University, the University of Chicago, the Fox Chase Cancer Center in Philadelphia, and the New York University Langone Health/Perlmutter Cancer Center.
