**background:** the National Heart Lung and Blood Institute (NHLBI) has launched an epidemiological cohort that focuses on Asian American, Native Hawaiian or Pacific Islander (NHPI) populations. It is called **MOSAAIC**, which stands for **M**ulti-ethnic **O**bservational **S**tudy in **A**merican **A**sian and **P**acific **I**slander **C**ommunities. This study aims to understand cardiovascular disease to improve prevention in these understudied populations.

the study will take place at six research institutions — the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Center in Seattle, Washington, the study’s coordinating center; and five clinical/community field centers — the University of Hawaii at Mānoa, Stanford University, the University of Chicago, the Fox Chase Cancer Center in Philadelphia, and the New York University Langone Health/Perlmutter Cancer Center. read more [here](https://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/news/2024/new-nhlbi-study-focuses-asian-americans-native-hawaiians-and-pacific-islanders)

**purpose:** generate an infographic that summarizes the study's 2023-2024 accomplishments, progress, goals, and recruitment approach for their anniversary celebration dinner.
