**what does 'ramen is my happy place' mean?** This print celebrates the little joys in life—like a hot bowl of ramen—that bring us comfort and happiness. There’s something magical in the ritual of slurping noodles, savoring rich broth, and picking out each topping, offering a mini escape from the world. May ramen always be a source of warmth and joy!

**what is riso?** risograph printing is a unique, eco-friendly printing process that originated in Japan in the 1980s. It’s known for its vibrant colors, grainy textures, and stencil-like effects, which make it popular for art prints, zines, posters, and other creative projects.

**how does it work?** risograph printers work similarly to screen printing. They use a digital duplicator to create a stencil, called a "master," for each color. The master is wrapped around a drum that rolls the ink onto the paper. Each color is printed in separate layers, allowing for rich and unusual color combinations. After one layer is printed, the paper is fed back through the machine, where another master with a different ink color is applied. This layering process enables overlapping colors, creating unique, sometimes unexpected color combinations.

Due to the nature of the process, Risograph printing often results in slight misalignments, known as “registration errors.” These small imperfections add to the charm and give each print a handmade, organic feel. Unlike offset printing, Risograph prints are rarely identical, making each print slightly unique.
