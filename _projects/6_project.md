**what does 'ramen is my happy place' mean?** this print celebrates the fact that ramen is not just about the food—it's about finding comfort, warmth, and a bit of joy in a single satisfying bowl. There’s something special about the ritual of slurping noodles, savoring rich broth, and picking out each topping, like a mini escape from the world. May ramen be your source of happiness and comfort!

**what is riso?** risograph printing is a unique, eco-friendly printing process that originated in Japan in the 1980s. It’s known for its vibrant colors, grainy textures, and stencil-like effects, which make it popular for art prints, zines, posters, and other creative projects.

**what's the process?** risograph printers work similarly to screen printing. They use a digital duplicator to create a stencil, called a "master," for each color. The master is wrapped around a drum that rolls the ink onto the paper. Each color is printed in separate layers, allowing for rich and unusual color combinations.
