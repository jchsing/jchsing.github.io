**background:** traditional résumés and CVs are meant to summarize a person’s professional journey as concisely as possible, leaning heavily on formulaic bullet points and flattened forms. While this approach to building and writing a resume is often necessary and valuable, there is a lot of uncharted territory when it comes to the creative expression of your journey, your interests, and the multi-dimensional form of your unique story.

**goal:** visualize the different facets of your academic and career journey in a way that tells a compelling story about the data of your life to-date. Highlight important transition points and pivotal discoveries, moments, and experiences that have shaped your world view and interests. What qualities of these transition points influenced a change in shape or direction?

I also tried to think about what were some good metaphors that could represent my journey. Here are some that I came up with...
<div class="row">
    <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include figure.liquid loading="eager" path="assets/img/dp1_meta1.png" title="idea_metaphor_1" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
    </div>
    <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include figure.liquid loading="eager" path="assets/img/dp1_meta2.png" title="idea_metaphor_2" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}

    </div>

Striking a balance between artistic design, quantitative clarity, and a professional résumé format was challenging. Defining key categories early on guided my process and helped shape the final product. Here’s how it turned out.
