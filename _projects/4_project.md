**background:** traditional résumés and CVs are meant to summarize a person’s professional journey as concisely as possible, leaning heavily on formulaic bullet points and flattened forms. While this approach to building and writing a resume is often necessary and valuable, there is a lot of uncharted territory when it comes to the creative expression of your journey, your interests, and the multi-dimensional form of your unique story.

**goal:** visualize the different facets of your academic and career journey in a way that tells a compelling story about the data of your life to-date. Highlight important transition points and pivotal discoveries, moments, and experiences that have shaped your world view and interests. What qualities of these transition points influenced a change in shape or direction?

    Left: I'm jotting down all major academic events that occured from 2012-2024. I'm also including potential axes and themes I might want to explore. Middle: I'm now plotting these points on a timeline and adding my personal and emotional thoughts and feelings during each time period. Right: Since this is still meant to be a resume, I'm writing down the key categories and components I want to put in the visual resume.

I also tried to think about what were some good metaphors that could represent my journey. Here are some that I came up with...
<div class="row">
    <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include figure.liquid loading="eager" path="assets/img/dp1_meta1.png" title="idea_metaphor_1" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}

    Not bad, but doesn't quite feel like a resume yet...

I struggled finding a balance between creating art, drawing a boring graph, and coming up with a resume. I kept in mind what categories I wanted in the resume, and these became my guiding compass. This is what the final product looked like.
